### A wordpress starter theme for dummies

Are you sick of the starter themes with all the extra fluff, but still want a theme that is a helpful starting point?  You found it.

This theme includes

* All the functionality of your wordpress theme you're trying to make, but without all the extra fluff
* Barebones, so you build your theme exactly how you want to
* Includes JQuery & Bootstrap, no downloading required (unless you want the most recent version)
* Free license, use the starter theme how you see fit
* Sassified, use sass to write your comments, or just delete the sass folder (we won't tell)
* Saves you precious time when creating custom wordpress themes for your customers (don't worry, you can still charge them the same)
* Documented, just enough to get you started, not enough to be annoying
